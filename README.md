# DEEL BACKEND TASK

Thank you for reading this exercise!

* To start, run `npm install`
* To run the unit tests, run `npm test`
* To start the server, for testing with Postman, start with `npm start`, and do the tests on port 3001



## Notes

* Please note that the unit tests are not completed, just shown some examples of them, for get and post methods

* This code includes a JSON schema validation for all endpoints that have inputs, stored in `src/schemas`, and a middleware to allow adding the tests of any route.

* Also, I divided the routes to different files, to make the easier to read and understand, at `src/routes`
