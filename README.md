# DEEL BACKEND TASK

Thank you for reading this exercise!

To run the unit tests, run `npm test`

This code includes a JSON schema validation for all endpoints that have inputs, stored in `src/schemas`, and a middleware to allow adding the tests of any route.

Also, I divided the routes to different files, to make the easier to read and understand, at `src/routes`

## Notes

Please note that the unit tests are not completed, just shown some examples of them, for get and post methods
